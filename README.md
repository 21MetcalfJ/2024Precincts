# Overview
![Current availability of precinct data in this repository.](/2024v8.png)
This repository contains a collection of precinct-level election returns, along with their respective precinct boundaries, for the 2024 general election. The above map shows which states I have collected data for. Not all of this data was collected by me; for each state, I have detailed my methodology in obtaining the data. This repository will continue to be updated as I collect more data. Currently, you can find data here for 25/50 states, plus Washington D.C. Incomplete states, such as on the map above, will be uploaded when the data collection is complete.

All states uploaded to this repository contain results for the 2024 presidential election. Some states also contain down-ballot data, including senatorial/congressional races and ballot initiatives. Click on each individual state to see what data is available.

Some data will come pre-joined with their precinct boundaries, and others will need to be joined with their respective .csv file.
