# Methodology



This data contains results for all statewide races and ballot referenda.





The shapefile was constructed from two sources; the [California Statewide Database](https://statewidedatabase.org/) provided precinct shapes and precinct results for 57/58 counties. The remaining precinct boundaries and data were provided by the Madera County Clerk's office.
