# Methodology



This data contains results for President. Data for other races can be obtained from the [California Statewide Database](https://statewidedatabase.org/d20/g24.html).



The shapefile was constructed from a variety of sources, in coordination with VoteHub. Where data was available, shapes/data from the CA SWDB were used. In most counties, this was not the case, and instead a consolidated precinct file was manually created using a registration precinct shapefile and a general election consolidation cross-reference sheet. There may be minor errors in the data; once the SWDB has published a comprehensive CA shapefile, this will be replaced with authoritative boundaries.
