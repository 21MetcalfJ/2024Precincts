# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. Both precinct data and precinct shapes were sourced primarily from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/presidential-precinct-map-2024). Extra work on the data was done to fix unmerged precincts and add precinct boundaries where no votes were cast. Results and boundaries for Phillips county were also obtained by me.
