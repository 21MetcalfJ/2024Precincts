# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from various county websites and offices. Precinct-level election results were obtained from the [South Dakota Secretary of State](https://electionresults.sd.gov/).

For Brookings, Brown, Douglas, Haakon, Hughes, Lawrence, Potter, Sully, and Yankton counties, votes were tabulated by vote center instead of precinct. For these counties, precinct totals were estimated using past results.
