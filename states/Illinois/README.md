# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from a variety of sources. In counties where precinct boundaries had not been changed since 2022, shapes from the [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/) were used. In other counties, updated boundaries were found from county map servers, county clerks, or on county websites. Precinct-level election results were obtained from the [Illinois Secretary of State](https://www.elections.il.gov/electionoperations/ElectionVoteTotalsPrecinct.aspx?ID=MVJQPFIDZQo%3D).
