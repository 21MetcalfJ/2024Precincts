# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President and U.S. House. 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from [here](https://www-tlstest.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0b4fbe4f3104487da8bc5087f9321705). Precinct-level election results were obtained from [here](https://voteidaho.gov/election-results/). 

Important note: absentee data was not allocated by precinct in certain counties. Here, data was allocated to the precinct level by its proportion of the election day vote. This may result in minor discrepancies in vote totals due to rounding errors in the allocation formula in the following counties:

-Boise  
-Boundary  
-Gem  
-Idaho  
-Jerome  
-Nez Perce  
-Owyhee  
-Shoshone  
-Twin Falls
