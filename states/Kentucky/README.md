# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President and U.S. House.

Precinct-level election results were obtained from the [Kentucky State Board of Elections](https://elections.hawaii.gov/election-results/). Keep in mind that these results are listed as being unofficial. However, there are very few discrepancies between these results and official county-level vote tallies.

Precinct boundaries were also obtained from the Kentucky State Board of Elections following the filing of an Open Records Request Form. Official boundaries were provided for every county except for Knox. In Floyd county, reported boundaries were unable to be matched to precinct results, and precinct boundaries generated by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/presidential-precinct-map-2024) were used instead. For Knox county, the 2020 Census VTD boundaries were used, as the county clerk informed me that their lines had not changed since the *1980s*. In the following counties, clarification from county authorities was needed to match precinct boundaries to their reported precinct code:
-Adair 
-Bell 
-Boone 
-Bourbon 
-Carlisle 
-Carter 
-Casey 
-Clay 
-Clinton 
-Crittenden 
-Fulton 
-Graves 
-Greenup 
-Lawrence 
-Letcher 
-McCracken 
-Montgomery 
-Spencer 
-Wayne 
-Warren 

There may also be minor topology errors present in the shapefile, as each individual county's precincts were merged together into one - particularly Pendleton county, whose file had a projection error that required correcting.
