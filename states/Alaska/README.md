# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President, U.S. House(first round only), as well as Ballot Measures 1(Minimum wage/paid sick leave) and 2(Ranked choice voting repeal). 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from [here](https://www.elections.alaska.gov/research/district-maps/). Precinct-level election results were obtained from [here](https://www.elections.alaska.gov/enr/). Important note: absentee data was reported only by house district, and was allocated to the precinct level by its proportion of the election day vote. This may result in minor discrepancies in vote totals, due to rounding errors in the allocation formula. Use this data with a grain of salt.
