# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. 

All precinct boundaries and election results were retrieved from local county election officials. The shapefile was manually constructed using voting precinct maps available on each county's GIS map server, and the data was transcribed from county Statements of Vote Cast.

Important: The precinct boundaries were recreated using census geometry. In a small number of precincts in a couple of counties, boundaries were originally drawn using parcel lines, which do not perfectly align with census geometry. However, this would not affect the populations or vote totals of the precincts, as differences were generally in rural areas with few, if any, voters.
