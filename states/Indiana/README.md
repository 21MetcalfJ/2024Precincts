# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from the [Indiana Geographic Information Office](https://www.indianamap.org/datasets/voting-district-boundaries-2023/about). Several counties, including Hamilton, Howard, Lake, and Shelby redrew their precinct lines and as such updated boundaries were obtained from county authorities. Precinct-level election results were partially obtained from the [Indiana Secretary of State](https://enr.indianavoters.in.gov/site/index.html).

NOTE: Results for Shelbyville, Indiana, are currently consolidated, as precinct lines were redrawn and I have been unable, so far, to obtain updated boundaries.
