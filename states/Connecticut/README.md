# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President and U.S. Senate. 

Precinct-level election results were obtained from the [Connecticut Election Management System](https://ctemspublic.tgstg.net).

The precinct shapefile was manually assembled by me. Boundaries were obtained in a few different ways; sometimes, town websites would have an available map of the precincts. In others, there would only be a street list or a description of each precinct's metes and bounds.
