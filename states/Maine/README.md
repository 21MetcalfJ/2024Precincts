# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President. Important note: these results are at the municipality level, *not* the precinct level. Results did not seem to be reported with any greater granularity.

Municipal boundaries were obtained from the [Maine GeoLibrary Data Catalog](https://www.maine.gov/geolib/catalog.html). Precinct-level election results were obtained from [here](https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html).
