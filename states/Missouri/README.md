# Methodology

This data contains results for U.S. President.

Creating an updated precinct shapefile for Missouri was a long-term project undertaken by me and @Missouri_Mapper on Twitter/X. Boundaries were obtained nearly exclusively from county authorities using map servers, photos of physical maps in county offices, and descriptions of boundary changes from previous elections. If you have specific questions about the data, feel free to ask.

Precinct-level election results were obtained from the Missouri Secretary of State.
