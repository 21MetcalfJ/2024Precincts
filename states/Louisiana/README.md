# Methodology

This data contains results for President, U.S. House, and Constitutional Amendment 1. Some parishes (Avoyelles and Webster) redrew their precinct boundaries since January of 2024 and needed updating. These lines were obtained from the respective parish election authorities. In others, precinct results or boundaries were consolidated where data did not perfectly match.

Precinct boundaries were obtained from [here](https://redist.legis.la.gov/default_ShapeFiles2020). Precinct-level election results were obtained from [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org/state/louisiana/).
