# Methodology
This data contains results for President and U.S. House.

Precinct data was collected by @DrewSavicki on Twitter/X. For most counties, 2020 VTD shapes were used, as counties had not updated their precinct lines. For Arapahoe, Fremont, and Prowers counties, updated lines were used. In each case, lines were obtained from county authorities; from webservers for Arapahoe and Fremont, and manually drawn referencing a .pdf for Prowers.
