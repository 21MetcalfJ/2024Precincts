This data contains results for President, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House. 

Precinct boundaries were obtained from a variety of sources. Boundaries from the 2022 general election were used as a baseline from Redistricting Data Hub. County offices were then called to confirm that the lines had not changed. If they had, the boundaries were updated with current lines. 

Precinct-level election results were obtained from various county officials.
